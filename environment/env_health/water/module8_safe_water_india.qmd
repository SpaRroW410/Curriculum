## Jal Jeevan Mission {.smaller}

### National Program for Water Supply

**Program Overview:**
- Launched: August 2019 by Government of India
- Goal: **100% Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC)**
- Target: Every household gets piped water (Jal Jeevan = Water Life)
- Implementation: Ministry of Jal Shakti
- Timeline: 2024 completion target

**Key Features:**
1. **Tap water in every house** (not communal hand pumps)
2. **Adequate quantity** (40-55 liters per capita per day)
3. **Safe quality** (treated, tested regularly)
4. **Continuous supply** (24-7 target)
5. **Community participation**

**Progress (as of 2024):**
- ~190 million households covered (out of 300+ million)
- ~60% coverage nationally
- State variation: Kerala >90%, others lower
- Acceleration ongoing

**Challenges:**
- Infrastructure cost (₹3.5 trillion estimated)
- Skilled workforce shortage
- Maintenance sustainability
- Water source availability in drought-prone areas
- Quality assurance at scale

---

## Census 2011 Water Access Data {.smaller}

### Baseline Assessment

**National Water Access Status (2011):**

**Rural Areas (70% of population):**
- **94% have access to safe drinking water** (improved sources)
  - Within premises: 46.6%
  - Near premises: 35.8%
  - Away from premises: 17.6%

**Urban Areas (30% of population):**
- **91% have access to safe drinking water**
  - Higher within-premises coverage
  - Better distribution infrastructure

**Improved Sources Definition:**
- Piped water household connection
- Public standpipe
- Borehole/tube well (protected)
- Protected dug-well
- Protected spring
- Rainwater collection (covered tank)

**Unimproved Sources:**
- Unprotected dug-well
- Unprotected spring
- Surface water (rivers, ponds, lakes)
- Vendor-supplied water carts
- Bottled water (quantity limitation)

---

## Census 2011 Analysis {.smaller}

### Interpreting the Data

**Achievements:**
- 94% rural + 91% urban = High average (92-93%)
- Indicates significant improvement post-independence
- Shows commitment to water provision

**Hidden Challenges:**
- **"Safe" may not mean actually safe** (testing not done)
- **Within-premises (46.6%) only minority** - majority walk for water
- **17.6% away from premises** - significant burden (fetching time, labor, contamination risk)
- **Water quality often not verified** - Just "improved source" not "safe"

**State Variation (Madhya Pradesh example):**
- Within premises: 23.9% (much lower than national 46.6%)
- Away from premises: 30.5% (much higher than national 17.6%)
- Indicates rural areas far from source
- Accessibility challenge

**Limitations of Census Definition:**
- Does not measure continuous supply
- Does not assess water quality
- Does not check treatment systems
- Does not monitor per capita quantity
- Static snapshot (2011 data, updated 2021)

---

## Problem Villages Criteria {.smaller}

### Defining Water Crisis Areas

**Definition:** Villages lacking adequate safe water sources

**4 Criteria (ANY ONE qualifies as Problem Village):**

**1. Distance from Safe Water Source:**
- No source within **1.6 kilometers**
- Population must walk >1.6 km to fetch water
- Burden on women & children (primary water fetchers)
- High labor cost, reduced time for other activities

**2. Water Table Depth:**
- Safe water available at **depth >15 meters**
- Hand pumps cannot reach (require mechanical pumps)
- High extraction cost
- Seasonal fluctuation risk (dries up in summer)

**3. Chemical Contamination:**
- Water source has **excess salinity**
- **Iron contamination** (causes staining, taste issues)
- **Fluoride excess** (dental/skeletal fluorosis risk)
- **Nitrates elevated** (cyanosis risk in infants)
- **Arsenic contamination** (cancer risk)
- Other toxic elements
- Water unsafe despite adequate quantity

**4. Disease Risk Exposure:**
- Water source **exposed to risks of cholera** or other epidemic diseases
- Proximity to sewage/latrine
- Flooding risk (contamination)
- Livestock grazing upstream
- No protective structures
- High microbial contamination likelihood

- Pump mechanism deteriorates rapidly (maintenance difficult)
- Summer: Water table drops to 20m (pump fails)
- Seasonal migration occurs
- Drinking from unprotected pond during crisis

**3. Chemical Contamination:**
- Well water tests: Fluoride 3.5 mg/L (3.5x safe level)
- Previous survey: 47% of children show dental fluorosis
- 8 elderly villagers diagnosed with skeletal fluorosis
- Health impact: Mottled teeth, mobility issues, quality of life

**4. Disease Risk:**
- Well located 40m upstream of community latrine
- During monsoon: Flooding contaminates well
- 2020: Diarrhea outbreak (35 cases, 2 deaths in children)
- Coliform testing positive (fecal contamination confirmed)
- No treatment system in place

**Meets ALL 4 Criteria → Official Problem Village**

## Major Chemical Challenges in India {.smaller}

### Beyond the Problem Village

**Fluoride Crisis:**
- **66 million at risk** in India
- Affected regions: Rajasthan, AP, Gujarat, MP, UP, Bihar
- Causes: Dental fluorosis (most common), skeletal fluorosis (severe)
- Solutions: Well switching, defluorination, dietary changes

**Arsenic Contamination:**
- **10 million at risk**
- Affected regions: West Bengal, Assam, parts of MP, UP
- Causes: Natural geological deposits + industrial contamination
- Health impact: Skin lesions, neuropathy, cancer risk (latency 10-20 years)
- Solutions: RO systems, well switching, monitoring

**Salinity (Brackish Water):**
- Affects coastal regions, arid areas
- Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu impacted
- NaCl concentration makes water unpalatable
- Causes: Geological, seawater intrusion, over-extraction
- Solutions: Reverse osmosis, alternative source development

**Nitrates (Agricultural Runoff):**
- Emerging concern in high-fertilizer areas
- Punjab, Haryana, western UP
- Cause: Excessive nitrogen fertilizer use
- Health risk: Cyanosis in infants (methaemoglobinaemia)
- Solutions: Improved agricultural practices, RO treatment

**Iron & Manganese:**

## Multi-Challenge Intervention {.smaller}

### When Multiple Issues Coexist

**Example: Region with Fluoride + Salinity + Distance Issues**

**Assessment:**
- Fluoride 2.0 mg/L (needs defluorination)
- Salinity: 1,500 mg/L TDS (RO-level treatment needed)
- Only source: 5 km away
- Population: 10,000

**Solution Selection:**
1. **Centralized treatment plant** (not individual home filters)
   - Economics: Bulk treatment more cost-effective
   - Capacity: 25,000 liters/day

2. **Multi-stage treatment system:**
   - Pre-filtration (sediment removal)
   - Reverse osmosis (removes both fluoride + salinity simultaneously)
   - Post-treatment (pH adjustment, remineralization)
   - Chlorination (residual protection)

3. **Distribution:**
   - Piped network to 400 homes
   - Public standpipes (for others)
   - Storage tank (emergency buffer)

4. **Cost:**
   - Capital: ₹2,000,000 (~$24,000)
   - Annual operating: ₹300,000 (~$3,600)
   - Per capita: Higher but manages multiple problems

5. **Timeline:** 12-18 months implementation
