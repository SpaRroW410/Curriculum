## Stage 2: Filtration - Overview {.smaller}

### Two Main Filtration Types

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Slow Sand Filter (SSF)
- **Biological process**

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Rapid Sand Filter (RSF)
- **Mechanical process**

:::
:::

**Key Principle:** Filtration removes 98-99% of bacteria

---

## SSF: Slow Sand Filtration {.smaller}

### Operating Characteristics

**Flow Rate:** 0.1-0.4 mm/hour (very slow)

**Sand Specifications:**
- Grain size: 0.2-0.4 mm (fine sand)
- Depth: 0.5-1.5 meters
- Supported by gravel layer (30-40 cm)
- Total surface area: ~15,000 m² per m³

**Filtration Duration:** 24-72 hours for water to pass through

**Pathogen Removal:** 90-99% bacterial reduction

---

## SSF: The Schmutzdecke Layer {.smaller}

### Biological Magic

**What is Schmutzdecke?**
- Biologically active layer at sand surface
- Forms naturally within 2-3 weeks
- Contains:
  - Algae (photosynthetic)
  - Protozoa (predatory)
  - Bacteria (beneficial)

**How it Works:**
1. **Mechanical straining** - Removes large particles
2. **Adsorption** - Traps fine particles & some chemicals
3. **Biochemical degradation** - Microbes break down organics
4. **Predation** - Protozoa consume bacteria & viruses

**Result:** Enhanced pathogen removal compared to sand alone
