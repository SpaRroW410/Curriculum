## Review: Water Quality Standards MCQs {.smaller}

### Question 1 {.quiz-question}

Which organic contaminant has the LOWEST guideline value due to high carcinogenicity?

- Benzene (10 µg/L)
- Vinyl chloride (0.5 µg/L)
- [Benzo[a]pyrene (0.7 µg/L)]{.correct}
- Carbon tetrachloride (2 µg/L)

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** Benzo[a]pyrene, a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), has the strictest guideline (0.7 µg/L) due to its potent carcinogenicity. It forms during incomplete combustion and was historically released from coal-tar pipe linings.
:::

---

### Question 2 {.quiz-question}

In the TDI formula GV = (TDI × bw × P) / C, the parameter 'P' represents:

- Portion of daily water intake
- [Proportion of TDI allocated to drinking water]{.correct}
- Percentage uncertainty factor
- Population body weight average

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** P is the allocation factor representing the fraction of total daily intake (TDI) attributed to drinking water. Typically P = 0.1 (10%) since most chemicals come from multiple sources (food, air, soil). For water-specific contaminants like disinfection by-products, P may be higher (0.5-0.8).
:::

---

### Question 3 {.quiz-question}

Stochastic effects of radiation differ from non-stochastic effects because:

- They have a threshold dose below which no effect occurs
- They are hereditary while non-stochastic are somatic
- [Their probability increases with dose but severity remains constant]{.correct}
- They only occur at very high radiation doses

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** Stochastic effects (like cancer) have NO threshold—probability increases with dose but severity doesn't change (cancer is cancer). Non-stochastic/deterministic effects (cataracts, burns) have thresholds and severity increases with dose. This distinction is crucial for radiation protection.
:::

## Water Sources: Selection Criteria

### Key Considerations

**Two Essential Criteria:**

**1. Quantity (Safe Yield)**
- Must be sufficient for present population
- Must accommodate future population (10-50 year design period)
- **Safe yield**: Adequate supply for 95% of the year (accounts for seasonal variation)

**2. Quality**
- Physical, chemical, microbiological acceptability
- Minimal treatment required (cost-effective)
- Consistent quality throughout the year

**Professional Assessment Required:**

Selection requires expertise from hydrogeologists, public health engineers, and epidemiologists to evaluate:
- Hydrogeology and aquifer characteristics
- Contamination risks from surrounding activities
- Infrastructure and treatment costs
- Community accessibility and acceptance

::: {.notes}
Many water supply failures result from poor source selection. For example, choosing a river downstream of industrial discharge requires extensive treatment. A protected spring might be preferable despite lower yield. Cost-benefit analysis must consider both capital and operational expenses over the project lifespan.
:::

## The Hydrological Cycle

### Water's Natural Journey

![Hydrological Cycle showing evaporation, precipitation, runoff, and infiltration](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/water-cycle-natural-water-cycle)

**Key Processes:**

1. **Evaporation**: Water from oceans, lakes, rivers → atmospheric vapor
2. **Transpiration**: Water absorbed by plants → released through leaves
3. **Precipitation**: Rain, snow, hail falling to earth
4. **Surface Runoff**: Water flows over land → streams → rivers → oceans
5. **Infiltration**: Water seeps into soil → groundwater recharge
6. **Groundwater Flow**: Subsurface movement toward rivers/oceans

**Water Balance:**

Rain = Evapotranspiration + Surface Runoff + Groundwater Recharge

*Source: U.S. Geological Survey*

::: {.notes}
The hydrological cycle is continuous and powered by solar energy. All freshwater ultimately comes from precipitation. Surface water and groundwater are interconnected—rivers are fed by groundwater in dry seasons; groundwater is recharged by rainfall infiltration. Contamination in one part affects the entire cycle.
:::

---

## Main Sources of Water

### Classification

**THREE PRIMARY SOURCES:**

**1. RAIN**
- Direct collection (rare as primary source)
- Rainwater harvesting (supplementary)
- Gibraltar, some islands depend on rain

**2. SURFACE WATER**
- **Impounding Reservoirs**: Artificial lakes, dams
- **Rivers and Streams**: Flowing water
- **Tanks, Ponds, Lakes**: Standing water

**3. GROUND WATER**
- **Shallow Wells**: Tap subsoil water (<20m depth)
- **Deep Wells**: Below first impervious layer (>20m depth)
- **Springs**: Natural groundwater outflow

**Selection Priority:**

Generally: Groundwater > Impounded surface water > Rivers > Tanks

::: {.notes}
Priority reflects treatment needs and contamination risk. Groundwater requires minimal treatment but pumping infrastructure. Surface water requires extensive treatment but gravity supply may be possible. Context matters—in Kerala, surface water (perennial rivers) is preferred; in Rajasthan, groundwater is primary source.
:::

---

## Rain as a Water Source

### Characteristics and Limitations

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Clear, bright, sparkling appearance
- Tasteless and odorless

**Chemical Characteristics:**
- **Purest water in nature** (~0.0005% dissolved solids)
- **Very soft**: Lacks calcium/magnesium salts
- Corrosive action on lead pipes due to softness
- Absorbs atmospheric gases (CO₂, SO₂, NO₂ in polluted areas)

**Microbiological:**
- Usually free from pathogenic organisms in clean districts
- Can carry microorganisms from air pollution

**Impurities in Rain:**
- **Dust and particulates**: Washout of atmospheric pollution
- **Gases**: CO₂ (forms weak carbonic acid), industrial emissions
- **Microorganisms**: Bacteria, fungal spores from air

**Practical Use:**
- Rainwater harvesting for groundwater recharge (India)
- Supplementary source during monsoons
- Emergency supply in water-scarce regions

::: {.notes}
While rain is chemically pure, it's rarely used as sole water source due to: (1) Seasonal availability, (2) Large collection surface area needed, (3) Storage requirements, (4) Atmospheric pollution concerns. However, rainwater harvesting has gained popularity in India (mandatory in many cities) to recharge groundwater and reduce flooding.
:::

---

## Impounding Reservoirs

### Characteristics and Quality

**Construction:**
- Artificial lakes created by dams across rivers/streams
- Earthwork or masonry construction
- **Catchment area**: Surrounding drainage area feeding reservoir

**Examples in India:**
- Mumbai (Tansa, Vaitarna, Tulsi lakes)
- Chennai (Poondi, Red Hills reservoirs)
- Nagpur (Totladoh reservoir)

**Water Quality:**

| Aspect | Characteristics |
|--------|----------------|
| **Clarity** | Usually clear and palatable |
| **Purity** | Ranks next to rainwater |
| **Hardness** | Soft (low mineral content) |
| **Color** | May be brownish if peat-covered hills in catchment |
| **Microbiological** | Generally safe if catchment protected |

**Disadvantage:**

Prolonged storage (months) leads to algae growth → bad taste and odors

::: {.notes}
Impounding reservoirs provide large, reliable supply with natural sedimentation and purification. Quality depends entirely on catchment area protection. If catchment has human habitation, grazing animals, or agricultural activity, contamination risk increases. Regular monitoring and catchment management are essential.
:::

---

## Impounding Reservoirs: Contamination Sources

### Protecting the Catchment Area

**Sources of Pollution:**

- **Human habitations**: Sewage, garbage disposal
- **Animal keeping/grazing**: Fecal contamination, urine
- **Agriculture**: Pesticides, fertilizers in runoff
- **Wild animals**: Even without human activity, wildlife can contaminate

**Myth vs. Reality:**

❌ "Mountain streams are always pure water"  
✅ Contamination possible even without nearby humans due to wild animals

**Protection Measures:**

1. **Fencing**: Prevent animal access to reservoir
2. **Land use restrictions**: No habitation/grazing in catchment
3. **Vegetation management**: Forest cover prevents soil erosion
4. **Regular inspection**: Monitor for encroachments
5. **Treatment**: Even protected reservoirs benefit from filtration/disinfection

::: {.notes}
The catchment area is the "production zone" for reservoir water. Mumbai's reservoirs have protected catchments spanning thousands of square kilometers with strict regulations. Despite this, wildlife (monkeys, deer, birds) can contaminate water, necessitating treatment. The myth of "pure mountain water" has caused outbreaks when untreated stream water is consumed.
:::

---

## Rivers and Streams

### Characteristics and Challenges

**Dependability:**
- Many rivers provide reliable year-round supply
- Major cities depend on rivers: Delhi (Yamuna), Kolkata (Hooghly), Allahabad (Ganga)

**Physical Characteristics:**
- **Turbidity**: Very high during monsoon (silt, clay, organic matter)
- May be relatively clear in dry season
- ⚠️ **Clarity ≠ Safety**: Clear river water can be heavily contaminated

**Chemical/Biological:**
- Contains dissolved and suspended impurities of all types
- High bacterial count including intestinal pathogens
- Coliform count often exceeds thousands per 100 mL

**Chief Drawback:**

**Always grossly polluted** → Unfit for drinking without extensive treatment

::: {.notes}
Rivers are described as "a direct connection between the alimentary canal of people upstream and the mouths of those below." This graphic statement reflects reality in India—most rivers receive untreated sewage from cities. The Yamuna in Delhi has fecal coliform counts 10,000× above safe limits. Despite this, millions depend on river water, making treatment infrastructure critical.
:::

---

## River Water: Sources of Contamination

### Why Rivers Are Polluted

**Major Pollution Sources:**

**1. Sewage and Sullage**
- Domestic wastewater from cities/towns
- Pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa
- Organic matter (high BOD)

**2. Industrial and Trade Wastes**
- Chemical effluents (heavy metals, dyes, acids)
- Thermal pollution (cooling water)
- Toxic organic compounds

**3. Agricultural Drainage**
- Fertilizers (nitrates, phosphates)
- Pesticides, herbicides
- Animal waste from farms

**4. Cultural/Religious Practices**
- Bathing, clothes washing
- Animal washing
- Disposal of cremated remains
- Direct defecation on riverbanks

**5. Surface Washings**
- Soil erosion, silt
- Urban runoff (oil, garbage)

::: {.notes}
In India, cultural and religious significance of rivers (Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari) leads to intensive use that paradoxically pollutes these sacred waters. The contradiction of revering rivers while contaminating them is a major challenge. Despite the Ganga Action Plan (1986) and Namami Gange (2014), pollution persists due to inadequate sewage treatment infrastructure.
:::

---

## Self-Purification of Rivers

### Natural Cleansing Mechanisms

**Do rivers purify themselves?**

**YES—to some extent**, but NOT sufficient for potability.

**Natural Purification Processes:**

**1. Dilution**
- Clean tributary water dilutes pollutants
- Effectiveness depends on flow rate

**2. Sedimentation**
- Heavier particles settle to river bed
- Reduces turbidity and some pathogens

**3. Aeration**
- Surface agitation dissolves atmospheric oxygen
- Enables aerobic bacterial degradation of organic matter

**4. Oxidation**
- Organic matter broken down by bacteria
- Reduces BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)

**5. Sunlight (UV)**
- UV radiation kills some bacteria (surface layer only)
- Limited penetration in turbid water

**6. Biological Activity**
- Aquatic plants, algae absorb nutrients
- Predatory microorganisms reduce pathogen counts

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:**

Self-purification **reduces** contamination but does NOT eliminate pathogens or chemicals → **Treatment still essential**

::: {.notes}
Self-purification was adequate when populations were small and pollution loads minimal. Today, pollution exceeds rivers' self-purification capacity. The Yamuna's dissolved oxygen near Delhi is often ZERO—no aerobic bacteria can survive. This "dead zone" extends for kilometers. Only after dilution by cleaner tributaries does some recovery occur. Self-purification cannot replace treatment.
:::

---

## Tanks, Ponds, and Lakes

### Village Water Sources

**Description:**
- Large excavations storing surface water
- Common in rural India (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh)
- Fed by rainwater runoff and streams

**Water Quality:**

| Season | Characteristics |
|--------|----------------|
| **Post-monsoon** | Highly turbid, full of silt and colloidal matter |
| **Dry season** | Clearer but contaminated from use |
| **All seasons** | Aquatic vegetation (older tanks) |

**Unlimited Contamination Possibilities:**

- **Washing**: Clothes, cooking vessels, animals
- **Bathing/swimming**: Humans, livestock
- **Defecation**: Around tank edges → washed in by rains
- **Open access**: No barriers to people or animals
- **Stagnation**: Ideal for vector breeding (mosquitoes)

**Health Impact:**

Major cause of waterborne disease outbreaks, especially in children. Responsible for incalculable cases of diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, and typhoid.

::: {.notes}
Tank water is often consumed without any treatment—not even boiling. Cultural practices (washing clothes, ritual bathing) are deeply rooted, making behavioral change difficult. Children swim in tanks (guinea worm transmission). During droughts, contamination concentrates as water levels drop. Tank improvement programs (fencing, filtration) have limited success without community engagement.
:::

---

## Improvement of Tanks

### Sanitary Measures

**Challenges:**
- Cultural resistance to access restrictions
- Poverty limits individual water treatment capacity
- Multiple uses (drinking, washing, irrigation) conflict with safety

**Recommended Improvements:**

**1. Physical Protection**
- Elevate tank edges to prevent surface washings
- Fence around tank → prevent animal access
- Elevated platform for drawing water (not entering tank)

**2. Hygiene Measures**
- Prohibit direct entry into tank
- Ban washing clothes, animals, utensils in tank
- Prevent bathing, swimming (especially important for guinea worm)

**3. Maintenance**
- Periodic weed removal
- Clean tank at end of dry season (remove accumulated sludge)

**4. Treatment**
- **Sand filtration**: Community-level slow sand filters
- **Chlorination**: Continuous or batch chlorination of tank water

**Reality Check:**

Despite recommendations, tanks remain contaminated because users are often among the poorest with limited sanitation awareness. **Simplest solution: Sand filtration + chlorination at point of use.**

::: {.notes}
The WHO/UNICEF report "Progress on Drinking Water and Sanitation" notes that improved water sources don't necessarily guarantee safe water. Tanks in India exemplify this—even with "improvements," contamination persists due to behavioral factors. Point-of-use treatment (household filters, chlorine tablets) may be more practical than source protection for tanks serving dispersed populations.
:::

---

## Groundwater: Advantages and Disadvantages

### Subsurface Water Resources

**ADVANTAGES:**

✓ **High mineral content**: Natural calcium, magnesium (makes water "hard")  
✓ **Likely pathogen-free**: Soil filtration removes bacteria/viruses  
✓ **Minimal treatment needed**: Often just disinfection  
✓ **Dependable supply**: Available even during droughts  
✓ **Less contamination risk**: Protected from surface pollution  

**DISADVANTAGES:**

✗ **Requires pumping**: Energy/infrastructure costs  
✗ **Very hard water**: Scaling in pipes/appliances, soap inefficiency  
✗ **Chemical contamination**: Fluoride, arsenic, nitrates in some aquifers  
✗ **Saline intrusion**: Coastal areas (excessive extraction → seawater infiltration)  
✗ **Limited recharge**: Over-extraction depletes aquifers  

**Best Use:**

Groundwater is ideal for rural/dispersed populations where piped surface water systems are uneconomical. India's rural water supply predominantly relies on hand pumps tapping groundwater.

::: {.notes}
Groundwater was traditionally considered "safe" due to natural filtration. However, chemical contamination (arsenic in West Bengal, fluoride in Rajasthan) has challenged this assumption. Over-extraction has lowered water tables—farmers drill deeper bore wells, escalating costs and energy use. Managed aquifer recharge through rainwater harvesting is now critical for sustainability.
:::

## Wells: Shallow vs. Deep

### Comparison

| Characteristic | **Shallow Wells** | **Deep Wells** |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Water source** | Subsoil water (above 1st impervious layer) | Confined aquifer (below 1st impervious layer) |
| **Depth** | Typically <20 meters | Often >50-100 meters |
| **Construction** | Dug manually or with simple equipment | Machine-drilled (requires specialized equipment) |
| **Yield** | Limited (may dry in summer) | High, constant supply |
| **Water quality** | Liable to pollution (surface infiltration) | Safer (natural filtration through deep soil layers) |
| **Hardness** | Moderately hard | Very hard (high mineral dissolution) |
| **Contamination risk** | **High** (latrines, septic tanks, drains nearby) | Low (if properly sealed) |
| **Prevalence in India** | Common in rural areas | Urban areas, large municipalities |
| **Cost** | Low capital, low maintenance | High capital, moderate maintenance |

**Key Insight:**

Shallow wells are **dangerous** if nearby contamination sources exist (50-foot rule often insufficient in India).

::: {.notes}
The 50-foot (15m) minimum distance between wells and latrines is based on soil percolation studies. However, in sandy/fractured rock, contaminants can travel much farther. Shallow wells in India often fail bacterial tests due to proximity to inadequate sanitation. Deep wells (tube wells) have revolutionized rural water supply but raise sustainability concerns due to aquifer depletion.
:::

---

## Dug Wells vs. Tube Wells

### Construction Types

**DUG WELLS (Open Wells):**

**Kutcha (Unlined) Wells:**
- Simple excavation without permanent lining
- Highly vulnerable to collapse and contamination
- Should be improved with lining or converted to hand-pump wells

**Pucca (Lined) Wells:**
- Brick/stone masonry lining
- Open top (major contamination risk)
- Common in rural India

**Step Wells:**
- Historical construction with steps descending into well
- Users enter well to fetch water → **direct contamination**
- Fortunately becoming obsolete

**TUBE WELLS:**

**Shallow Tube Wells (Driven Wells):**
- Galvanized iron pipe driven/bored into aquifer
- Strainer at bottom, hand pump at top
- Largest individual source for rural India

**Deep Tube Wells (Bored Wells):**
- Drilled through successive strata to deep aquifer
- Hundreds of feet deep
- Requires electric/diesel pumps
- High yield, reliable supply
- Example: Chandigarh relies entirely on deep tube wells

::: {.notes}
The India Mark II hand pump on tube wells has been revolutionary for rural water supply—simple, maintainable by villagers, consistent water quality. However, tube well spacing is critical (150-200m minimum) to prevent interference and over-extraction. The transition from open dug wells to tube wells dramatically reduced waterborne diseases in areas where implemented systematically.
:::

---

## Sanitary Wells: Design Criteria

### Essential Features

**1. LOCATION (50-foot / 15-meter rule)**
- ≥15m from contamination sources (latrines, septic tanks, drains, manure pits)
- Higher elevation than pollution sources (if slope exists)
- ≤100m from users (convenience → encourages use)

**2. LINING**
- Watertight brick/cement lining to ≥6m (20 feet) depth
- Lining extends 60-90 cm (2-3 feet) above ground

**3. PARAPET WALL**
- 70-75 cm (28 inches) height above ground
- Prevents surface water entry, provides safety

**4. PLATFORM**
- Cement-concrete apron extending ≥1m (3 feet) in all directions
- Gentle outward slope toward drain

**5. DRAIN**
- Pucca drain carries spilled water away
- Empties into soakage pit beyond well's "cone of filtration"

**6. COVERING**
- Cement-concrete cover over well top ⭐ (most important)
- Studies show covering alone greatly improves water quality

::: {.notes}
The "sanitary well" concept recognizes that well water safety depends on construction, not just source. Covering the well prevents: (1) Direct contamination (dropping objects, children, animals), (2) Mosquito breeding, (3) Evaporation. Studies in Bangladesh found that simply covering wells reduced diarrhea by 30-40%, even without other interventions. This highlights the importance of simple, low-cost protective measures.
:::

---

## Sanitary Wells: Additional Requirements

### Hand Pumps and Maintenance

**7. HAND-PUMP**
- Robust construction (withstands rough handling)
- Eliminates buckets/ropes → prevents contamination
- Hand pumps alone improve water quality significantly
- Requires efficient maintenance service (immediate repairs)

**8. WATER QUALITY**
- Must conform to WHO/IS standards (physical, chemical, microbiological)
- Regular testing (quarterly minimum)
- Monitoring for arsenic, fluoride, nitrates (endemic areas)

**9. CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY**
- Maintain cleanliness around well
- Prohibit personal ablutions, washing clothes/animals
- No individual buckets/ropes (use pump only)
- Carry water in clean vessels to homes
- **Requires health education** → community ownership

**10. FILTER MEDIUM**
- Sand bed: Effective diameter 0.2-0.3 mm
- Clean, free from clay and organic matter
- Gravel support layer (30-40 cm) prevents sand loss

::: {.notes}
Community participation is the weakest link in sanitary well programs. Wells are constructed properly but deteriorate within years due to lack of maintenance and hygiene violations. Successful programs combine: (1) Infrastructure (well + pump), (2) Education (hygiene promotion), (3) Ownership (village water committee for maintenance). Kerala's Jalanidhi program demonstrates that community-managed wells can sustain quality long-term.

::: {.notes}
This simplified cross-section shows the key elements. The parapet wall and raised lining prevent surface runoff from entering. The platform and drain carry away spilled water. The 15m distance (cone of filtration) is the minimum—in sandy/fractured soils, 30m or more may be needed. The watertight lining to 6m depth prevents shallow groundwater contamination from reaching the well.
:::

## Springs

### Natural Groundwater Emergence

**What are Springs?**

Groundwater flowing naturally to surface under natural pressure (no pumping needed).

**Types:**

**1. Shallow Springs**
- Emerge from perched water table (above first impervious layer)
- Fed by local rainfall
- Dry up quickly in summer months

**2. Deep Springs**
- Emerge from confined aquifer
- Fed by distant recharge areas
- **Do not show seasonal fluctuations** (perennial flow)
- Preferred for water supply

**Advantages:**
- No pumping costs (gravity flow)
- Generally good quality (filtered through soil/rock)
- Reliable flow (deep springs)

**Disadvantages:**
- Exposed to surface contamination at emergence point
- Require protection structures
- Limited availability (geographically specific)

::: {.notes}
Springs are excellent water sources if properly protected. Hill stations (Shimla, Ooty, Darjeeling) historically relied on spring water. However, the emergence point is vulnerable—animals drinking, human contact, surface runoff can contaminate. Protection requires: (1) Spring box (concrete structure enclosing emergence), (2) Fencing (prevent animal access), (3) Piped conveyance (avoid open channels). Unprotected springs are as risky as surface water.
:::

## Module 4 Summary

### Key Takeaways

**Water Source Selection:**

✓ Two criteria: Sufficient quantity (safe yield) + Acceptable quality

✓ Rain is purest but impractical as sole source; useful for harvesting

✓ Impounding reservoirs provide reliable, good quality supply if catchment protected

✓ Rivers are always polluted; require extensive treatment; self-purification insufficient

✓ Tanks are highly contaminated; improvement requires filtration + chlorination

✓ Groundwater generally safer than surface water but requires pumping

✓ Shallow wells vulnerable to contamination; deep wells/tube wells preferable

✓ Sanitary well construction essential: covering well alone greatly improves quality

✓ Springs excellent if protected at emergence point

**Selection Priority:**

Deep groundwater > Protected reservoirs > Shallow groundwater > Rivers > Tanks

## Assessment: Module 4 MCQs {.smaller}

### Question 1 {.quiz-question}

The "safe yield" of a water source is defined as:

- The maximum quantity that can be extracted without depleting the source
- [The yield adequate for 95% of the year]{.correct}
- The volume meeting design period population needs
- The flow rate during lowest rainfall season

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** Safe yield is defined as the yield adequate for 95% of the year, accounting for seasonal variations. This ensures reliability even during dry periods. It's used to assess whether a source can meet demand over the design period (typically 10-50 years).
:::

---

### Question 2 {.quiz-question}

Which statement about river self-purification is CORRECT?

- Rivers completely purify contaminated water within 10-20 km
- Self-purification makes river water safe without treatment
- [Self-purification reduces contamination but does not eliminate pathogens or chemicals]{.correct}
- Sunlight-induced UV disinfection is sufficient for potability

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** While rivers have natural purification mechanisms (dilution, sedimentation, aeration, oxidation, UV), these processes REDUCE but do NOT eliminate contamination to safe levels. Today's pollution loads far exceed rivers' self-purification capacity. Treatment is always necessary for drinking water.
:::

---

### Question 3 {.quiz-question}

The MOST important single measure to improve dug well water quality is:

- Installing a hand pump
- Constructing a platform and drain
- [Covering the well top with concrete slab]{.correct}
- Maintaining 15-meter distance from latrines

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** Studies show that covering wells alone causes marked improvement in bacteriological quality by preventing: (1) direct contamination from objects/animals falling in, (2) mosquito breeding, (3) manual drawing with contaminated ropes/buckets. While all measures are important, covering provides the greatest single impact on water safety.
:::

---

### Question 4 (Application-Based) {.quiz-question}

A village has three water source options: (A) River 2 km away requiring pumping and extensive treatment, (B) Shallow wells with nearby latrines, (C) Deep tube wells requiring drilling and pumps. Which should be prioritized?

- Option A - Rivers are most reliable
- Option B - Shallow wells are cheapest
- [Option C - Deep tube wells despite higher cost]{.correct}
- Use all three sources together

::: {.notes}
**Explanation:** Deep tube wells (Option C) are best because: (1) Low contamination risk (aquifer isolation), (2) Minimal treatment needed, (3) Reliable year-round, (4) Long-term operational costs lower than treating river water. Initial drilling cost is offset by reduced treatment and water quality reliability. Shallow wells near latrines (Option B) are unsafe. Rivers (Option A) require perpetual treatment costs.
