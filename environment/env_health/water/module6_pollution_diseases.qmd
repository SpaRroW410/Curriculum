## Pollution Indicators {.smaller}

### What Are Pollution Indicators?

**Definition:** Measurable parameters that reflect water contamination status

**Categories of Indicators:**

1. **Physical Indicators** - Turbidity, color, temperature
2. **Chemical Indicators** - BOD, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorides
3. **Microbiological Indicators** - Coliform organisms, fecal streptococci
4. **Biological Indicators** - Aquatic organism presence/absence

---

## Physical Pollution Indicators {.smaller}

### Visible Water Quality Parameters

**Turbidity:**
- Suspended solids causing cloudiness
- Measured in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)
- WHO guideline: <1 NTU for drinking water
- Indicates: Sediment, algae, pathogens likely

**Color:**
- Measured in TCU (True Color Units) or Hazen units
- Drinking water guideline: <5 TCU
- Natural colors: Tannins, iron (brown), algae (green)
- Artificial colors: Dyes, industrial chemicals

**Temperature:**
- WHO guideline: <25°C preferred
- Indicates: Shallow contamination sources
- High temp favors bacterial growth

**Taste & Odor:**
- Subjective but important
- Indicates: Chemical contamination, algal growth
- Affects public acceptance of water

---

## Chemical Pollution Indicators {.smaller}

### Measuring Organic & Inorganic Load

**Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):**
- Measures organic matter decomposition
- High BOD: Indicates organic pollution
- Bacteria consume dissolved oxygen
- Can lead to anoxic conditions (fish kills)
- Guideline: <5 mg/L

**Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):**
- Measures all oxidizable matter
- Includes recalcitrant compounds
- Often COD > BOD
- Higher priority pollutant indicator

**Dissolved Oxygen (DO):**
- Essential for aquatic life
- Low DO: Indicates decomposition
- Fish need: >4-5 mg/L
- Anoxia: <2 mg/L leads to deaths

**Nitrogen & Phosphorus:**
- Excess causes eutrophication
- Algal blooms result
- Reduces sunlight penetration
- Depletes oxygen

---

## Microbiological Indicators {.smaller}

### Detecting Bacterial Contamination

**Coliform Organisms:**
- Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli family)
- Natural habitat: Animal intestines
- Presence indicates: Fecal contamination
- Drinking water standard: **Zero (absent in 100 mL)**

**Fecal Coliform (E. coli):**
- More specific to fecal contamination
- Human/animal gut bacteria
- Indicates: Recent/direct contamination
- Drinking water standard: **Absent**

**Fecal Streptococci:**
- Human/animal intestinal bacteria
- Indicates: Fecal contamination
- More resistant than E. coli
- Used to distinguish human vs animal sources

**Clostridium Perfringens:**
- Spore-forming bacterium
- Survives water treatment better than vegetative bacteria
- Indicates: Remote or past contamination
- Used for treatment efficacy assessment

---

## Microbiological Testing Methods {.smaller}

### Laboratory Detection Techniques

**Presumptive Coliform Test:**
- Multiple tube method (traditional)
- Tubes with lactose broth media
- Gas production indicates coliforms
- Confirmation needed for identification

**Confirmatory Tests:**
- EMB (Eosin-Methylene Blue) agar plates
- Gram staining
- Culture isolation
- Biochemical identification

**Membrane Filtration Technique:**
- Water filtered through 0.45 μm membrane
- Membrane placed on selective media
- Colonies counted after incubation
- Modern quantitative method
- Advantage: Direct count of organisms

**Colony Count:**
- Heterotrophic plate count (HPC)
- Total bacteria on plate
- Non-specific indicator
- High counts suggest general contamination

---

2. **Sedimentation** - Particles settle
3. **Aeration** - Water oxygenation
4. **Oxidation** - Chemical decomposition
5. **Sunlight** - Bacterial/chemical breakdown
6. **Aquatic life** - Organisms consume organics

**Limitations:**
- Insufficient for high pollution loads
- Takes time (24-72 hours typical)
- Completely overwhelmed in severely polluted rivers
- **Example:** Indian rivers (Yamuna, Ganges) require extensive treatment

---

## Urban vs Industrial Water Pollution {.smaller}

### Context Matters

**Urban Pollution (Dilute):**
- Sewage from residential areas
- Moderate contaminant levels
- Typically: Organic matter, coliforms
- Treatment: Standard water works sufficient

**Industrial Pollution (Concentrated):**
- Chemical factories, refineries, textiles
- High levels of toxic substances
- Persistent organic pollutants
- Treatment: Advanced methods (activated carbon, RO, oxidation)

**Mixed Urban-Industrial:**
- Cities with industries
- Combined sewage overflows
- Variable pollution loads
- Requires flexible treatment

---

## Health Impact Assessment {.smaller}

### Evaluating Disease Risk

**Dose-Response Relationship:**
- **Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI):** Safe chronic exposure
- **Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI):** Non-carcinogen daily safe dose
- **No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL):** Below effect threshold
- **Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL):** Lowest harmful dose

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Applied to NOAEL to determine safe standards
- Accounts for: Inter-species variation, human sensitivity, data gaps
- Typical UF: 100-1000x (human variation: 10x, species: 10x)

**Example Calculation:**
- Animal NOAEL: 100 mg/kg/day
- Uncertainty factor: 1000
- **Human ADI:** 0.1 mg/kg/day

**Guideline Value Derivation:**
- Based on TDI/ADI
- Accounts for water consumption (2L/day typical)
- Often 1-2% of ADI allocated to drinking water
