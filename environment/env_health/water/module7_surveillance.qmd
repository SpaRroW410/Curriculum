---

## Fecal Indicator Organisms {.smaller}

### Understanding Test Interpretation

**E. coli (Fecal Coliform):**
- Most specific fecal indicator
- Human & animal intestines
- Indicates recent/direct contamination
- Drinking water standard: **Absent (0 CFU/100mL)**
- If present: System failure, immediate action needed

**Fecal Streptococci:**
- Human & animal origins (distinguishable by species)
- More resistant than E. coli
- Indicates: Fecal contamination (less recent)
- Helps assess contamination age/source
- Ratio E. coli:Strep helps determine source

**Total Coliforms:**
- Environmental organisms (some non-fecal)
- Include: E. coli + other coliforms
- Indicates: Potential for contamination
- Drinking water standard: **Absent or <5% samples**
- Less specific than E. coli alone

**Clostridium perfringens:**
- Spore-forming anaerobe
- Indicates: Remote/past contamination
- More resistant to treatment & disinfection
- Used: To assess treatment adequacy
- Especially useful for RO/UV system verification

---

## Colony Count Procedures {.smaller}

### Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC)

**Purpose:**

- Indicates water quality broadly
- Early warning system

**Procedure:**
- Dilute water samples (10⁻¹, 10⁻², etc.)
- Plate on nutrient agar media
- Incubate 48 hours at 35-37°C
- Count colonies (30-300 range optimal)
- Calculate CFU/mL

**Interpretation:**
- <1000 CFU/mL: Good water quality
- 1000-10,000: Acceptable (investigate source)
- >10,000: Indicates problem (contamination or stagnation)
- Sudden increase: Potential breach in system

**Limitations:**
- Does not identify organisms
- Does not distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic
