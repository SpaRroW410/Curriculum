## What is One Health?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Definition:**

One Health is a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach working at local, regional, national, and global levels with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes.

**Core Recognition:**

The health of people is closely connected to the health of animals and our shared environment.

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
U.S. Government Definition established in 2017. The approach recognizes that approximately 60% of emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, originating from animals. Environmental factors like water quality directly impact both human and animal health.
:::

---

## The One Health Triad

### Three Interconnected Pillars

**1. Human Health**
- Disease surveillance and control
- Public health infrastructure
- Healthcare systems
- Epidemiological monitoring

**2. Animal Health**
- Veterinary services
- Livestock management
- Wildlife health monitoring
- Zoonotic disease tracking

**3. Environmental Health**
- Water quality and sanitation
- Air pollution control
- Soil health
- Ecosystem biodiversity

::: {.notes}
Each pillar affects and is affected by the others. For example, antimicrobial use in livestock (Animal Health) can contaminate water sources (Environmental Health), leading to antimicrobial resistance affecting humans (Human Health).
:::

---

## Why One Health Matters for Water

### The Water-Health Nexus

**Water as a Critical Interface:**

- **Pathogen Transmission**: Waterborne zoonotic diseases (leptospirosis, schistosomiasis)
- **Chemical Contamination**: Agricultural runoff (nitrates, pesticides) from animal farming
- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**: Antibiotics from animal waste entering water systems
- **Environmental Reservoirs**: Water bodies as habitats for disease vectors (mosquitoes, snails)

**One Health Application:**

Water contamination requires integrated solutions addressing human practices (sanitation), animal management (waste disposal), and environmental protection (watershed management).

::: {.notes}
Example: Nitrate contamination in groundwater results from excessive use of animal manure and chemical fertilizers (agriculture/animal health), contaminates drinking water (environmental health), and causes methemoglobinemia in infants (human health). This exemplifies the One Health interconnection.
:::

---

## Zoonotic Pathogens in Water

### The Hidden Threat

**Major Waterborne Zoonotic Diseases:**

| Disease | Pathogen | Animal Reservoir | Transmission Route |
|---------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Leptospirosis** | *Leptospira* bacteria | Rats, cattle, dogs | Contaminated water, soil |
| **Cryptosporidiosis** | *Cryptosporidium* | Livestock, wildlife | Fecal-contaminated water |
| **Giardiasis** | *Giardia* protozoa | Cattle, pets, wildlife | Contaminated water sources |
| **Avian Influenza** | H5N1, H7N9 viruses | Poultry, wild birds | Water bodies, live markets |
| **Schistosomiasis** | *Schistosoma* | Aquatic snails | Freshwater contact |

**One Health Surveillance:** Monitoring water sources for both human and animal pathogens provides early warning of disease outbreaks.

::: {.notes}
Leptospirosis outbreaks in India often follow monsoon flooding when rat urine contaminates floodwaters. One Health approach requires coordinated rodent control, sanitation improvement, and public health awareness.
:::

---

## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Water

### A Growing Crisis

**The AMR-Water Connection:**

- **Source**: 75-90% of antibiotics administered to livestock are excreted unchanged
- **Pathway**: Animal waste → manure → agricultural runoff → surface/groundwater
- **Impact**: Resistant bacteria and resistance genes contaminate drinking water sources

**Consequences:**

1. **Human Health**: Infections become harder to treat
2. **Animal Health**: Reduced efficacy of veterinary antibiotics
3. **Environmental Health**: Disruption of aquatic microbial ecosystems

**One Health Solution:** Integrated approach to regulate antibiotic use in humans, animals, and agriculture while improving wastewater treatment.

::: {.notes}
India is one of the world's largest consumers of antibiotics in livestock production. Studies have detected resistance genes in rivers, lakes, and even treated drinking water. The One Health approach mandates coordinated action across healthcare, veterinary services, and environmental sectors.
:::

| 3 | **Telangana** | 69.96 | Digital integration, urban WASH |
| 4 | **Andhra Pradesh** | 69.95 | Veterinary services, food safety |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 18 | **Bihar** | 19.00 | Needs improvement across all sectors |
| 19 | **Uttar Pradesh** | 34.00 | Gaps in surveillance, sanitation |

**Regional Disparities:**
- Southern states consistently outperform northern/eastern states
- Urban-rural divide in One Health capacity
- Smaller states (Mizoram, Tripura) show strong performance despite size

*Source: NITI Aayog Health Index Report, 2021*

::: {.notes}
Kerala's top ranking reflects its strong public health systems, high literacy, effective surveillance, and inter-sectoral coordination. States like Bihar and UP face challenges in basic infrastructure, requiring targeted One Health investments.
:::

## WASH + One Health Integration

### Water, Sanitation, Hygiene under One Health

**Why WASH is Central to One Health:**

WASH interventions prevent disease transmission across the human-animal-environment interface:

- **Safe Water**: Prevents waterborne zoonoses (leptospirosis, cryptosporidiosis)
- **Sanitation**: Breaks fecal-oral transmission of pathogens from humans and animals
- **Hygiene**: Reduces direct contact with animal reservoirs and contaminated surfaces

**One Health WASH Framework:**

1. **Integrated Water Quality Monitoring**: Test for human AND animal pathogens
2. **Livestock Waste Management**: Prevent contamination of water sources
3. **Community Hygiene**: Educate on zoonotic disease prevention
4. **Environmental Sanitation**: Protect ecosystems supporting disease vectors

*Source: PLOS Water Journal, "Towards a One Health approach to WASH", 2024*

::: {.notes}
Traditional WASH programs focus on human health. One Health WASH expands this to include animal health (veterinary WASH) and environmental health (ecosystem protection), recognizing that 80% of rural households in India live with livestock.
:::

---

## Water Quality Surveillance: A One Health Application

### Integrated Monitoring Systems

**Conventional Approach:**
- Monitor water for human pathogens only (E. coli, coliforms)
- Reactive response after disease outbreaks

**One Health Approach:**
- Monitor for human, animal, and environmental health indicators
- Proactive surveillance for early warning

**Example: Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE)**

```r
# One Health Surveillance Data Integration
surveillance_data <- data.frame(
  Indicator = c("E. coli", "Leptospira", "Antibiotic Residues", 
                "Cryptosporidium", "Nitrate Levels"),
  Human_Health = c("High", "Medium", "High", "High", "High"),
  Animal_Health = c("Medium", "High", "High", "High", "Medium"),
  Env_Health = c("Medium", "Medium", "High", "Low", "High")
)
```

**Application:** COVID-19 wastewater surveillance detected viral RNA before clinical cases emerged, demonstrating the power of environmental monitoring for human disease.

::: {.notes}
Wastewater surveillance is a quintessential One Health tool. It monitors human pathogens (COVID, polio), animal pathogens (avian influenza), and environmental contaminants (AMR genes, heavy metals) simultaneously, providing early warning for public health interventions.
:::

---

## Case Study: Cholera Outbreaks and One Health

### The Human-Animal-Environment Nexus

**Background:**
Cholera (*Vibrio cholerae*) outbreaks in India often correlate with monsoon flooding and contaminated water sources.

**One Health Analysis:**

| Component | Contributing Factors |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Human** | Poor sanitation, open defecation, crowded slums |
| **Animal** | Aquatic reservoirs (fish, shellfish), livestock near water sources |
| **Environment** | Flooding, water stagnation, temperature rise, algal blooms |

**One Health Interventions:**

1. **Human**: Oral rehydration therapy, vaccination campaigns, hygiene education
2. **Animal**: Monitor aquatic animal health, regulate fish farming practices
3. **Environment**: Improve drainage, protect water sources, climate adaptation

**Outcome:** Integrated approach reduces cholera incidence by 60-70% compared to single-sector interventions.

::: {.notes}
The 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak demonstrated the consequences of ignoring the environment pillar. Contaminated river water (environmental failure) mixed with poor sanitation (human failure) caused a massive epidemic. One Health demands simultaneous action across all three sectors.
:::

---

## One Health in Climate Change Context

### Emerging Challenges

**Climate-Water-Health Linkages:**

- **Extreme Weather**: Floods contaminate water sources, droughts concentrate pathogens
- **Temperature Rise**: Expands vector habitats (mosquitoes, snails) in water bodies
- **Altered Rainfall**: Disrupts seasonal water availability, increases contamination
- **Ecosystem Disruption**: Changes animal migration patterns, spreads diseases

**One Health Climate Adaptation:**

```python
# Climate-sensitive disease forecasting model
climate_factors = {
    'temperature': 'increases vector breeding',
    'rainfall': 'floods lead to waterborne disease outbreaks',
    'humidity': 'affects pathogen survival in water',
    'extreme_events': 'infrastructure damage → sanitation failure'
}
```

**India-Specific Impacts:**
- Increased dengue/malaria in previously non-endemic areas
- More frequent waterborne disease outbreaks post-floods
- Climate refugees migrating to areas with poor WASH infrastructure

::: {.notes}
Climate change is a threat multiplier for One Health. India experienced record floods in 2023-2024, leading to major waterborne disease outbreaks. One Health preparedness requires climate-resilient WASH infrastructure and early warning systems linking meteorological and epidemiological data.
